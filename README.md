Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers


A compatibility-based "Friend Finder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

Express is used to handle routing and the app will be depoloyed to Heroku so other users can fill it out.
